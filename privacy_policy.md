Privacy is your right and you have the choice
As a customer you have the choice which information you would like to share with us. Of course we need some information for the fulfillment of our contract. However, this does not always require all the data which you can make available to us.

 

You can take the following steps to disclose less information about yourself:


No data sharing: If you don't want to share any information with us at all, that's a shame. In this case we can't convince you how great our products are.

What data we process
 

In the following description of our processing activities, we refer in each case to categories of personal data. A category includes several personal data, which are usually processed together for the purposes.

Personal data is information that can identify you or even make you identifiable.

We generally process the following categories of personal data for the following reasons:

 

Contact Information:

Name, address, telephone number, email address, your ID from any social media  (if applicable).

 

Reason:

If you contact us, we collect this data because we need to know who we are talking to and what we have been talking about so that we can help you with your reason for contacting us. This also applies if you leave comments on social media on our fan pages. We do not combine this data with your profile data on our platform, but we can still identify you by your social media ID.

 

Location data:

Address, Postcode, City, Country, Longitude, Latitude

 

Reason:

We need these data to be able to deliver your orders. We create the longitude and latitude automatically in order to be able to process your delivery address in our other linked systems, such as our Rider app, and to display your address to our riders or riders of restaurants.

 

Profile data (master data):

Name, email address, password, telephone number, delivery addresses, interests, demographic data (age, delivery address)

 

Reason:

This data is your master data, which we absolutely need for our services. Without an email address / telephone number and a password, you cannot create a profile. Together with your name, this is your master data. We need your age to ensure that you are not a minor.

 

Device information and access data:

Device ID, device identification, operating system and corresponding version, time of access, configuration settings, information on Internet connection (IP address)

 

Reason:

With each access this information is stored by us for technical reasons. We also use parts of this information to detect suspicious behaviour at an early stage and to avert damage.

 

Order information:

Order history, selected restaurants, invoices, order ID, comments on orders, information on payment method, delivery address, successful orders and cancelled orders

 

Reason:

Each time you place an order, this information will be added to your profile. You can view all this information in your profile at any time. The information should give you an overview of your own interests and previous orders. We will also use the same information to improve our services. In addition, we will anonymize this information when you request a deletion or when your profile becomes inactive in order to continue to use this information in an anonymized form to optimize our services.

 

Communication data

Name, email address, telephone number, device ID

 

Reason:

If you would like to receive a newsletter, an SMS or an in-app push notification from us, we need certain information to send you the messages. Instead of addressing you with "Hey You", we find it more customer friendly to address you with your name. This category of personal information is also used by us to contact you, for example, if a product cannot be delivered and we want to offer you an alternative instead.



Delivery information:

Name, delivery address, phone number, order ID

 

Reason:

In accordance with the principle of data minimization, we only provide our riders and mart with the information that they need from you to prepare and deliver your order.

 

For which purposes we process data
We process your personal data only in accordance with the strict legal requirements. We pay particular attention to the fact that all principles for the processing of personal data are taken into account. The Delivery Hero Group pays great attention to transparency. Therefore, we only process your data if this is lawful and you can reasonably expect it to be processed. If, in the course of our evaluation, we come to the conclusion that the processing cannot reasonably be expected, we will only carry out the processing with your express consent.

 

ACCOUNT CREATION, SSO REGISTRATION, ADMINISTRATION OF YOUR PROFILE
In order to be able to offer you our services, the processing of your personal data is essential. Much of this data you transmit to us and other parts of the data we collect automatically when using our platforms. Nevertheless, we endeavour to keep the amount of data as small as possible. You can help us by only sharing necessary data with us that we need to fulfill our contractual obligations.

Newsletter
If you have provided us with your phone number address when purchasing goods or services or creating an account on our platform, we reserve the right to send you regular offers of similar goods or services to those already purchased from our range by email.

Not only do the contents of our newsletters vary, but so do the technologies and criteria we use to design our newsletters and segment customer groups. For example, a group of customers may receive a special newsletter promoting special deals from restaurants where customers have ordered. Other newsletters may refer to specific products that relate to a particular flavour, such as sushi, Indian delicacies or pizza.

We use different information from your order history and delivery addresses.

This is a profiling process in which we automatically process your data. The specific customer segmentation can have a legal effect on you or can have a significant effect on you in other ways if you receive certain newsletters and are not included in other campaigns.

 

If automated decision making leads to a negative result for you and you do not agree with this, you can contact us at support@foodpanda.mm. In this case, we will individually assess the circumstances of your case.

Besides other means we continue to use SMS to inform you about new deals in your area. You will only receive an SMS from us if you have given your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time for the future. Please send us an e-mail to goglobalschool15@gmail.com. The registration as well as the cancellation is free of charge for you.
